# The Whacking Stick
The whacking stick is a fun item that deals large amounts of knockback to mobs you whack. There is nothing more satisfying than sending a mob flying off a cliff, as shown in the image below. It's fast attack speed can be very useful in early-game situations such as being attacked by a creeper, or if you are being attacked by a swarm of mobs since it allows you to keep a good distance from them. The whacking stick also has customizable hit sounds that adds another layer of enjoyability when using it.
